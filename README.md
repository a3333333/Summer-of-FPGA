**Audio Synth - Summer of FPGA Design Challenge - Element 14**

https://community.element14.com/challenges-projects/design-challenges/summer-of-fpga/


**Target audience**

These are some Verilog projects and Arduino sketches reflecting my experience learning FPGA programming. My blog on elemnt14 was written specifically for a software engineer who is interested in learning FPGA programming. I admit that what I am offering there is a very personal perspective. As an engineer, I did my share of embedded software and real-time development some time ago. I was also fortunate enough to have taken some courses in digital system design and DSP a long time ago so I do have some theoretical knowledge, although I feel that I need to do a lot of brushing up.

**PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT I AM A BEGINNER AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I AM WRITING VERILOG CODE.**
